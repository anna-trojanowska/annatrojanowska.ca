                    <p>The mobile app for the laundry-challenged. LaundryTime is a mobile application designed to help you do your laundry in a way that both optimizes cleaning quality and the longevity of your clothing. (The purpose of this school project was to create high-fidelity prototypes for use in our Behance portfolios. Our class followed Behance guidelines and best practices to create a case study that highlights key factors that directed the development of our app)</p>
