                <h4>Art Direction & Illustration</h4>
                <p> An old colleage asked me to draw a portrait of herself with the two children that she nannies. The challenge was creating a composition where all three individuals looked like they were part of the same portrait (only having reference photos of each person by themselves).</p>
