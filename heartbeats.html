                    <h4>Art Direction & Tactile Stop Motion</h4>
                    <p>I had a great time with this project and hope to do more tactile stop motion in the future. Setting up shots was a bit of a challenge because I had to maneuver through branches to set up my model in between takes. However, I think the final result was worth the struggle. The photographs were taken with my Nikon D3100, edited in LightRoom, and the video was created in AfterEffects.</p>
