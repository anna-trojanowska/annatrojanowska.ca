                <h4>Typesetting & Illustration</h4>
                <p> This is an event poster for an Oasis cover band called <i>Supersonic</i>. The intention was to give the poster the same kind of look and feel that an actual Oasis poster would have. The guitarist in the design could even be mistaken for Noel Gallagher and for this reason the top of the body is cropped out to keep the figure annonymous.  </p>
